# Matplotlib-Seaborn-Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains the Data Analytics libraries of python like Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization of data analysis. The analysis focuses on Data visualization. 

## Libraries used
- **Pandas** : For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** : For the data visualization.

## Files
-  **`scripts/`**: Contains the Python scripts for data analysis.
- **`data/`**: Iris dataset csv file used in the analysis (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris).

## Getting Started

These insructions are help to run the assessment.

- Install the required python libraries : `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the analysis script: `python scripts/main_analysis.py`.

## Features
- In these Assessment all data analytics libraries are used for analysis of iris dataset.
- Pandas is used for the data manipulation and analysis of dataset.
- Matplotlib is used for data visualization of different parameter of dataset to different types of plots.
- Here, with matplotlib there were line plot, scatter plot, bar plot etc. are used for visualization.
- Seaborn plots are very attractive compare to matplotlib. Here, heatmap and pairplot used.
